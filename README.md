# What is the idea for a publication?

Approximately 490 small businesses are evicted each month in New York City, according to a report from the New York City Landlord and Tenant Courts. Small business owners have zero leverage when it comes to renewing leases. Once a lease expires, there is no limit on what the landlord can charge in rent. A landlord is also not obliged to offer a lease renewal if that was not part of the original agreement. 

There’s a surge in closing and shuttered shops across Manhattan. Landlords appear willing to trade a short-term loss for a chance to eventually land a much more affluent tenant, like a bank or national retail chain. Even some of these deep pockets businesses are closing down due to skyrocketing rents. A Starbucks at 33rd and 5th recently closed when their lease topped $1 million a year.

In 2014, the city experienced the largest increase in chain stores in four years, and the sixth straight year of growth in chains, bringing the tally to 7,473 throughout the city, according to a report from the Center for an Urban Future.

High commercial rents are changing the city. The publication would track this growing trend and analyze/comment on the fluctuations in rents, cycles of types of businesses in certain city areas (retail, restaurants, service, what-not, etc.), the shelf-life of tenants, changes in the cityscape, how live-ability is affected, etc. 

# Give a few general examples of pieces that might run on this site?

# Components of the project: 

•	Illustrating the trend / problem on a larger scale
Seeing these changes visually with an interactive map that highlights the number of recently (2013 - to date) closed small businesses and the number of chain drug stores and banks. 

•	Personalizing the problem
Providing video components with interviews of small business owners, landlords, city councilmembers and an expert on urban economics.

•	Providing an economic analysis. 
What is the impact on New York’s municipal economy and the gross national product (G.N.P)?

•	What are the politics? 
            Real Estate Board of New York lobbying efforts, Small Business Jobs Survival Act

# Who is your audience?
Small business owners and New York City residents. 

# Is there a similar publication? 
Not that I know of. Jeremiah's Vanishing New York is a blog that features pictures and blurbs about the small businesses that have closed.
